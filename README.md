## Deploy to your PC
1. First download the project source code.
2. It is recommended to use **IntelliJ 2023.2.4** or later to open the project. The file structure of the project is shown in the figure. ![img.png](./imgs/img.png)
3. Run **DAVS-install-package1.bat**, **DAVS-install-package2.bat**, **DAVS-install-package3.bat** in sequence. These three files are used to automatically download the project dependencies.
4. Configure the **Ganache** or **Sepolia**
    1. If deploying to **Ganache**, download [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to your PC first.
        1. Open Ganache and click the "NEW WORKSPACE" button, as shown in the picture. ![img_1.png](imgs/img_1.png)
        2. Name your WORKSPACE by any name, as shown in the figure. ![img_2.png](imgs/img_2.png)
        3. Configuration in SERVER, as shown in Figure. ![img_3.png](imgs/img_3.png)
        4. Click the "START" button in the upper right corner to start the Ganache blockchain, and the interface after startup is shown in the figure. ![img_4.png](imgs/img_4.png)
        5. Open the project in the contracts/hardhat.config.ts file, will be in the picture above the RPC SERVER to fill out the url in the following code.
            ```typescript jsx
                 ganache: {
                     url:'http://127.0.0.1:8545' // 本地网络——ganache区块链端口
                 }
            ```
    2. If deploying to **Sepolia**, make sure you already have at least one Sepolia Test Network account address and a small amount of ETH.
        1. Open the project in the contracts/hardhat.config.ts file, will your RPC URL, chainId respectively wrote below the address and the purse to the private key code in the URL, chainId, and in the account.
            ```typescript jsx
                 sepolia: {
                       url:'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/802ff1f6ca554c3ea370f0acebae425d', // 公共网络——Sepolia区块链端口
                       chainId: 11155111,
                       accounts: ['',] // 钱包的私钥地址 / Input your private key here if you need to deploy to the Sepolia test network
                    }
            ```
5. If you are **not modifying** any of the back-end (Solidity) code, skip this step. Otherwise, if you want to **modify** the back-end (Solidity) code, compile the modified code in Remix, and copy the three contracts (*DonationAndVotingSystemContract.sol*, *GoldContract.sol*, *AwardContract.sol*. **Note that StringHelper does not need to compile!!**) ABI (as shown). ![img_5.png](imgs/img_5.png)
    1. Open front-end/src/utils/abis in the project and you should see 3 files as shown in the figure. ![img_6.png](imgs/img_6.png)
    2. Replace the ABI values in each of the three json files with the abi values you just copied, as shown in the figure. ![img_7.png](imgs/img_7.png)
6. In the IntelliJ interface, click the button at the top, as shown in the picture. ![img_8.png](imgs/img_8.png)
7. Add the configuration of the deployment contract.
    1. If you are using **Ganache**, configuring it as shown in the figure. ![img_9.png](imgs/img_9.png)
    2. If you are using **Sepolia**, following the instructions in the figure to configure it. ![img_10.png](imgs/img_10.png)
8. Add the configuration to run the front-end program, as shown in the figure. ![img_11.png](imgs/img_11.png)
9. Deploy contracts to a blockchain network.
    1. If you are using **Ganache**, run the deploy-ganache you just configured.
        1. A terminal will run and you will see the addresses of the three contracts, copy them, as shown in the figure. ![img_12.png](imgs/img_12.png)
        2. Open the front-end/src/utils/contract-addresses.json file in the project and fill in the addresses you just copied into the following code.
            ``` json
             {
                 "DonationAndVotingSystemContract": "0x123456789",
                 "GoldContract": "0x987654321",
                 "AwardContract": "0x123454321"
             }
            ```
   2. If you are using **Sepolia**, run the deploy-sepolia you just configured.
      1. A terminal will run and you will see the addresses of the three contracts, copy them, as shown in the figure. ![img_12.png](imgs/img_12.png)
      2. Open the front-end/src/utils/contract-addresses.json file in the project and fill in the addresses you just copied into the following code.
        ``` json
         {
             "DonationAndVotingSystemContract": "0x123456789",
             "GoldContract": "0x987654321",
             "AwardContract": "0x123454321"
         }
        ```
10. Run react start just configured, wait for a period of time, you can use this project! __Remember to configure the network (Ganache / Sepolia) you want to connect in MetaMask wallet.__
